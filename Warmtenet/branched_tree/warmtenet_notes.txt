TO DO:

 --> made SSH key: DONE!

(!)	--> global optimum by cutting loops? 

 	--> iterate over price

(!) 	--> cutting at junctions (these points are the ones with negative mean-profit, averaged over p2p)

	--> realistic input data (warmtevraag, prijs, threshold)

 	--> calculate profit with fixed price, not personal threshold!

 	--> ecological profit: count as costs the sum of all differences between fixed price and alternative energy price (or what they WANT to pay) 
			for all households who would want to join (i.e. are points in the graph) but the energy supplier has chosen not to do so because of profit

 	--> people may be willing to pay more for the most sustainable alternative, i.e. warmtenet (https://www.tudelft.nl/en/delft-outlook/articles/how-sustainable-is-electric-heating)

 	--> more generally, we can define a price in terms of CO2-emissions, i.e. low 'price' means high CO2-reduction

 	--> On a neigbourhood-level, we want to be able to compare pure profit with ecological impact (especially iterating over prices)
